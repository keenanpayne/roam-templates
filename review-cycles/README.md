# Review Cycles in Roam

These are roughly the same templates I use to conduct my review cycles in Roam. Feel free to use them as much as you would like! 

## Notes
### Namespacing
You'll see that I make liberal use of namespaces in Roam, such as `my/Review Cycles` or `my/Habit Tracking`.

I'm a software developer, so this is my way of making some of my pages more programmatic — as if they're an API. I don't do this for everything, but I use it quite often for things I want to reference by namespace and not by name. 

### Putting things in front of you
Specifically, in my daily template, you might notice that I have a lot of structure to it. I do this because I am much more likely to follow-through with or remember to do things such as journaling, thinking, etc., if I have big headings right in front of me. For me, putting these headings so prominently on my daily template encourages me to write in these sections.

I don't follow-through with writing in these sections every day, but that's not the point. The point is to put the most important things in front of me so that every day if I have a thought, an idea, an anecdote, whatever, I can easily capture it and either continue to elaborate on it or move on. 

This won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it's something to consider. What would you want to encourage yourself to do in Roam every day? 

### Nesting review cycles beneath `my/Review Cycles`
Why do I nest all of the notes for my review cycles beneath a backlink to `my/Review Cycles`? 

I'm taking advantage of how Roam creates relationships between content by ensuring every single review cycle is related to a higher-level page, which is `my/Review Cycles`. I guess this is _kind of_ like putting notes in folders, which I suppose is heresy to some, but I like this framework for organizing notes for certain circumstances. 

The nice thing about nesting every review cycle beneath a single backlink is that you can see all of your review cycles on a single page. Then, with the additional `Type` attribute for each page, you can filter by what type of review cycle it is.

## Usage
The way I structure my review cycles may not be how you structure your review cycles, and that's great! I encourage you to take the parts you're inspired by or parts that you could put to use, mix them in with whatever you're currently doing, or use them to create something entirely new. 

## Acknowledgements
I have to give a huge shoutout to [August Bradley](https://www.youtube.com/user/augustbradley/videos), who significantly influenced how I think about and structure my review cycles. I highly recommend checking out his videos on the subject if you want to learn more about how he thinks about and implements his review cycles.
