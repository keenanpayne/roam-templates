# Roam Templates

Hello there 👋🏻 My name is [Keenan Payne](https://keenanpayne.com), and I'm a software developer based out of San Francisco. I'm also a life-long thinker and learner, committed to growth in all dimensions. 

I wanted to share some of the templates I currently use with [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/). Others have inspired me by sharing their templates, so I thought it would be nice to provide mine for others to reference.

All of these templates are in flux, and they get changed frequently the more I use them and reflect on how well they're serving me. I'll try to keep them as up-to-date with what I'm currently doing as possible, but I think the smallest details of what I'm doing are less important than the framework I'm using to accomplish certain things in Roam by utilizing the features that make Roam a unique piece of software. 

You are welcome to use these wherever you would like, change them up to fit your context, share them with a friend — do whatever you want.
